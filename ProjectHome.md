A C/C++ library for automating applications through a TCP or serial port. This makes it very easy to automate applications for test or for other purposes.

Your functions and variables are exposed as a tree view with a minimum of coding and allows you to have a consistent way of providing automation for everything from embedded (e.g. Arduino) projects to large enterprise applications.

The automation interface is licensed under the apache 2.0 license allowing you to use it in any way you see fit.

We are releasing this automation interface as open source to make it even easier to integrate products with our graphical system testing tool [SeqZap](http://seqzap.com/).

We plan to expand the supported languages with .net, Python and LabView in the future.
