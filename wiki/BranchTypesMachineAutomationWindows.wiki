= Introduction =

Information about the windows shown on the screens of the machine.

All windows on the screen is modeled as an opaque byte-array which is
mapped to which ever data structure makes the most sense in the
implementation of the machine automation server.

The windows are reference counted, so when a function returns a new
byte-array, it has already been "ref'ed" by the callable - but the
caller must manually make sure to call unref on the window when it is
no longer needed - otherwise the machine automation server will have
to keep the window in memory forever.

|| name || string ( byte-array ) || Get the name of the window. ||
|| process_id || int ( byte-array ) || Get the id of the process which owns the window. ||
|| text || string ( byte-array ) || Get the text of the window, e.g. the text on a button or label. ||
|| role || string ( byte-array ) || Get the role of the window, is it a "window" or a "button" or a "label" (TODO: Specify which different roles we expect there to be). ||
|| x || int ( byte-array ) || Get the top-left X coordinate of the window, in screen coordinates. ||
